# NAME

Geo::Gpx - Create and parse GPX files

# SYNOPSIS

    my ($gpx, $waypoints, $track);

    # From an open file or an XML string
    $gpx = Geo::Gpx->new( input => $fh );
    $gpx = Geo::Gpx->new( xml => $xml );

    my $waypoints = $gpx->waypoints();
    my $tracks    = $gpx->tracks();

# DESCRIPTION

`Geo::Gpx` supports the parsing and generation of GPX data. GPX 1.0 and 1.1 are supported.

## Constructor

- new( args \[, use\_datetime => true/false )

    Create and return a new `Geo::Gpx` instance based on an array of points that can each be constructed as [Geo::Gpx::Point](https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo%3A%3AGpx%3A%3APoint) objects or with a supplied XML file handle or XML string.

    If `use_datetime` is set to true, time values in parsed GPX will be [DateTime](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime) objects rather than epoch times. (This option may be disabled in the future in favour of a method that can return a [DateTime](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime) object from a specified point.)

## Methods

- waypoints( \\@waypoints )

    Initialize waypoints based on an array reference containing either a list of [Geo::Gpx::Point](https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo%3A%3AGpx%3A%3APoint)s or hash references with fields that can be parsed by [Geo::Gpx::Point](https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo%3A%3AGpx%3A%3APoint)'s `new()` constructor. See the later for the possible fields.

    Returns the array reference of [Geo::Gpx::Points](https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo%3A%3AGpx%3A%3APoints) stored as waypoints.

- add\_waypoint( \\%point \[, \\%point, â€¦ \] )

    Add one or more waypoints. Each waypoint must be either a [Geo::Gpx::Point](https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo%3A%3AGpx%3A%3APoint) or a hash reference with fields that can be parsed by [Geo::Gpx::Point](https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo%3A%3AGpx%3A%3APoint)'s `new()` constructor. See the later for the possible fields.

        %point = ( lat => 54.786989, lon => -2.344214, ele => 512, time => 1164488503, name => 'My house', desc => 'There\'s no place like home' );
        $gpx->add_waypoint( \%point );

          or

        $pt = Geo::Gpx::Point->new( %point );
        $gpx->add_waypoint( $pt );

    Time values may either be an epoch offset or a [DateTime](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime). If you wish to specify the timezone use a [DateTime](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime). (This behaviour may change in the future.)

- iterate\_waypoints()
- iterate\_trackpoints()
- iterate\_routepoints()

    Get an iterator for all of the waypoints, trackpoints, or routepoints in a `Geo::Gpx` instance, as per the iterator chosen.

- iterate\_points()

    Get an iterator for all of the points in a `Geo::Gpx` instance, including waypoints, trackpoints, and routepoints.

        my $iter = $gpx->iterate_points();
        while ( my $pt = $iter->() ) {
          print "Point: ", join( ', ', $pt->{lat}, $pt->{lon} ), "\n";
        }

- bounds( $iterator )

    Compute the bounding box of all the points in a `Geo::Gpx` returning the result as a hash reference.

        my $gpx = Geo::Gpx->new( xml => $some_xml );
        my $bounds = $gpx->bounds();

    returns a structure like this:

        $bounds = {
          minlat => 57.120939,
          minlon => -2.9839832,
          maxlat => 57.781729,
          maxlon => -1.230902
        };

    `$iterator` defaults to `$self->iterate_points` if not specified.

- xml( $version )

    Generate and return an XML string representation of the instance.

    If the version is omitted it defaults to the value of the `version` attribute. Parsing a GPX document sets the version. If the `version` attribute is unset defaults to 1.0.

- TO\_JSON

    For compatibility with [JSON](https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON) modules. Convert this object to a hash with keys that correspond to the above methods. Generated ala:

        my %json = map { $_ => $self->$_ }
         qw(name desc author keywords copyright
         time link waypoints tracks routes version );
        $json{bounds} = $self->bounds( $iter );

    With one difference: the keys will only be set if they are defined.

## Accessors

- name( $str )
- desc( $str )
- copyright( $str )
- keywords( $aref )

    Accessors to get or set the `name`, `desc`, `copyright`, or `keywords` fields of the `Geo::Gpx` instance.

- author( $href )

    The author information is stored in a hash that reflects the structure of a GPX 1.1 document. To set it, supply a hash reference as (`link` and `email` are optional):
      {
        link  => { text => 'Hexten', href => 'http://hexten.net/' },
        email => { domain => 'hexten.net', id => 'andy' },
        name  => 'Andy Armstrong'
      },

- link( $href )

    The link is stored similarly to the author information, it can be set by supplying a hash reference as:
      { link  => { text => 'Hexten', href => 'http://hexten.net/' } }

- time( $epoch or $DateTime )

    Accessor for the &lt;time> element of a GPX. The time is converted to a Unix epoch time when a GPX document is parsed unless the `use_datetime` option is specified in which case times will be represented as [DateTime](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime) objects.

    When setting the time you may supply either an epoch time or a [DateTime](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime) object.

- routes( $aref )

    Return an array reference containing the routes of the instance. In the future, methods will be provided to set routes. In the meantime, to set the routes of the GPX instance, supply an array of hash references structured as:

        my $aref = [
          { 'name' => 'Route 1',
            'points' => [ <list_of_Geo_Gpx_Point> ]
          },
          { 'name' => 'Route 2',
            'points' => [ <list_of_Geo_Gpx_Point> ]
          },
        ];

- tracks( $aref )

    Returns an array reference containing the routes of the instance. In the future, methods will be provided to set tracks. In the meantime, to set the tracks of the GPX instance, supply an array of hash references structured as:

        my $aref = [
          { 'name' => 'Track 1',
            'segments' => [
              { 'points' => [ <list_of_Geo_Gpx_Point> ] },
              { 'points' => [ <list_of_Geo_Gpx_Point> ] },
            ]
          }
          { 'name' => 'Track 2',
            'segments' => [
              { 'points' => [ <list_of_Geo_Gpx_Point> ] },
              { 'points' => [ <list_of_Geo_Gpx_Point> ] },
            ]
          }
        ];

- version()

    Returns the schema version of a GPX document. Versions 1.0 and 1.1 are supported.

## Legacy methods provided for compatibility

These methods will likely removed soon as they reflect a very dated release of this module.

- gpx()

    Synonym for `xml()`.

- gpsdrive()
- loc()

    Provided for compatibility with version 0.10.
