# NAME

Geo::Gpx - Create and parse GPX files

# SYNOPSIS

    my ($gpx, $waypoints, $track);

    # From an open file or an XML string
    $gpx = Geo::Gpx->new( input => $fh );
    $gpx = Geo::Gpx->new( xml => $xml );

    my $waypoints = $gpx->waypoints();
    my $tracks    = $gpx->tracks();

# DESCRIPTION

`Geo::Gpx` supports the parsing and generation of GPX data. GPX 1.0 and 1.1 are supported.

## Constructor

- new( args \[, use\_datetime => $bool, work\_dir => $working\_directory )

    Create and return a new `Geo::Gpx` instance based on an array of points that can each be constructed as [Geo::Gpx::Point](https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo%3A%3AGpx%3A%3APoint) objects or with a supplied XML file handle or XML string.

    If `use_datetime` is set to true, time values in parsed GPX will be [DateTime](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime) objects rather than epoch times. (This option may be disabled in the future in favour of a method that can return a [DateTime](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime) object from a specified point.)

    `work_dir` or `wd` for short can be set to specify where to save any working files (such as with the save\_laps() method). The module never actually [chdir](https://metacpan.org/pod/chdir)'s, it just keeps track of where the user wants to save files (and not have to type filenames with path each time), hence it is always defined.

    The working directory can be supplied as a relative (to [Cwd::cwd](https://metacpan.org/pod/Cwd%3A%3Acwd)) or absolute path but is internally stored by `set_wd()` as a full path. If `work_dir` is omitted, it is set based on the path of the _$filename_ supplied or the current working directory if the constructor is called with an XML string or a filehandle.

- clone()

    Returns a deep copy of a `Geo::Gpx` instance.

        $clone = $self->clone;

## Methods

- waypoints( $int or name => $name )

    Returns the array reference of waypoints when called without argument.

    With an argument, returns a reference to the waypoint at integer index _$int_ (1-indexed) or whose `name` field is an exact match with _$name_. Returns `undef` if none are found (no exception raised) such that this method can be used to check if a specific point exists.

- waypoints\_add( \\%point \[, \\%point, … \] )

    Add one or more waypoints. Each waypoint must be either a [Geo::Gpx::Point](https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo%3A%3AGpx%3A%3APoint) or a hash reference with fields that can be parsed by [Geo::Gpx::Point](https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo%3A%3AGpx%3A%3APoint)'s `new()` constructor. See the later for the possible fields.

        %point = ( lat => 54.786989, lon => -2.344214, ele => 512, time => 1164488503, name => 'My house', desc => 'There\'s no place like home' );
        $gpx->waypoints_add( \%point );

          or

        $pt = Geo::Gpx::Point->new( %point );
        $gpx->waypoints_add( $pt );

    Time values may either be an epoch offset or a [DateTime](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime). If you wish to specify the timezone use a [DateTime](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime). (This behaviour may change in the future.)

- waypoints\_search( $field => $regex )

    returns an array of waypoints whose _$field_ (e.g. `name`, `desc`, …) matches _$regex_. By default, the regex is case-sensitive; specify `qr/(?i:search_string_here)/` to ignore case.

- waypoints\_count()

    returns the number of waypoints in the object.

- waypoints\_delete\_all()

    delete all waypoints. Returns true.

- waypoint\_delete( $name )

    delete the waypoint whose `name` is an exact match, case sensitively. Returns true if successful, `undef` if the name cannot be found.

- waypoints\_merge( $gpx, $regex )

    Merge waypoints with those contained in the [Geo::Gpx](https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo%3A%3AGpx) instance provide as argument. Waypoints are compared based on their respective `name` fields, which must exist in _$gpx_ (if names are missing in the current instance, all points will be merged).

    A _$regex_ may be provided to limit the merge to a subset of waypoints from _$gpx_.

    Returns the number of points successfully merged (i.e. the difference in `$gps->waypoints_count` before and after the merge).

- waypoint\_closest\_to( $point of $tcx\_trackpoint )

    From any [Geo::Gpx::Point](https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo%3A%3AGpx%3A%3APoint) or [Geo::TCX::Trackpoint](https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo%3A%3ATCX%3A%3ATrackpoint) object, return the waypoint that is closest to it. If called in list context, returns a two-element array consisting of that waypoint, and the distance from the coordinate (in meters).

- routes( integer or name => 'name' )

    Returns the array reference of routes when called without argument. Optionally accepts a single integer referring to the route number from routes aref (1-indexed) or a key value pair with the name of the route to be returned.

- routes\_add( $route or $points\_aref \[, name => $route\_name )

    Add a route to a `Geo::Gpx` object. The _$route_ is expected to be an existing route (i.e. a hash ref). Returns true. A new route can also be created based an array reference(s) of [Geo::Gpx::Point](https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo%3A%3AGpx%3A%3APoint) objects and added to the `Geo::Gpx` instance.

    `name` and all other meta fields supported by routes can be provided and will overwrite any existing fields in _$route_.

- routes\_count()

    returns the number of routes in the object.

- tracks( integer or name => 'name' )

    Returns the array reference of tracks when called without argument. Optionally accepts a single integer referring to the track number from tracks aref (1-indexed) or a key value pair with the name of the track to be returned.

- tracks\_add( $track or $points\_aref \[, $points\_aref, … \] \[, name => $track\_name \] )

    Add a track to a `Geo::Gpx` object. The _$track_ is expected to be an existing track (i.e. a hash ref). Returns true.

    If &lt;$track> has no `name` field and none is provided, the timestamp of the first point of the track will be used (this is experimental and may change in the future). All other fields supported by tracks can be provided and will overwrite any existing fields in _$track_.

    A new track can also be created based an array reference(s) of [Geo::Gpx::Point](https://metacpan.org/pod/Geo%3A%3AGpx%3A%3APoint) objects and added to the `Geo::Gpx` instance. If more than one array reference is supplied, the resulting track will contain as many segments as the number of aref's provided.

- tracks\_count()

    returns the number of tracks in the object.

- iterate\_waypoints()
- iterate\_trackpoints()
- iterate\_routepoints()

    Get an iterator for all of the waypoints, trackpoints, or routepoints in a `Geo::Gpx` instance, as per the iterator chosen.

- iterate\_points()

    Get an iterator for all of the points in a `Geo::Gpx` instance, including waypoints, trackpoints, and routepoints.

        my $iter = $gpx->iterate_points();
        while ( my $pt = $iter->() ) {
          print "Point: ", join( ', ', $pt->{lat}, $pt->{lon} ), "\n";
        }

- bounds( $iterator )

    Compute the bounding box of all the points in a `Geo::Gpx` returning the result as a hash reference.

        my $gpx = Geo::Gpx->new( xml => $some_xml );
        my $bounds = $gpx->bounds();

    returns a structure like this:

        $bounds = {
          minlat => 57.120939,
          minlon => -2.9839832,
          maxlat => 57.781729,
          maxlon => -1.230902
        };

    `$iterator` defaults to `$self->iterate_points` if not specified.

- xml( $version )

    Generate and return an XML string representation of the instance.

    If the version is omitted it defaults to the value of the `version` attribute. Parsing a GPX document sets the version. If the `version` attribute is unset defaults to 1.0.

- TO\_JSON

    For compatibility with [JSON](https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON) modules. Convert this object to a hash with keys that correspond to the above methods. Generated ala:

        my %json = map { $_ => $self->$_ }
         qw(name desc author keywords copyright
         time link waypoints tracks routes version );
        $json{bounds} = $self->bounds( $iter );

    With one difference: the keys will only be set if they are defined.

- save( filename => $fname, key/values )

    Saves the `Geo::Gpx` instance as a file.

    The filename field is optional unless the instance was created without a filename (i.e with an XML string or a filehandle) and `set_filename()` has not been called yet. If the filename is a relative path, the file will be saved in the instance's working directory (not the caller's, `Cwd`).

    _key/values_ are (all optional):

        `force`:      overwrites existing files if true, otherwise it won't.
        `extensions`: save `<extensions>…</extension>` tags if true (defaults to false).
        `meta_time`:  save the `<time>…</time>` tag in the file's meta information tags if true (defaults to false). Some applications like MapSource return an error if this tags is present. (All other time tags elsewhere are kept.)

- set\_filename( $filename )

    Sets/gets the filename. Returns the name of the file with the complete path.

- set\_wd( $folder )

    Sets/gets the working directory and checks the validity of that path. Relative paths are supported for setting but only full paths are returned or internally stored.

    The previous working directory is also stored in memory; can call &lt;set\_wd('-')> to switch back and forth between two directories.

    Note that it does not call [chdir](https://metacpan.org/pod/chdir), it simply sets the path for the eventual saving of files.

## Accessors

- name( $str )
- desc( $str )
- copyright( $str )
- keywords( $aref )

    Accessors to get or set the `name`, `desc`, `copyright`, or `keywords` fields of the `Geo::Gpx` instance.

- author( $href )

    The author information is stored in a hash that reflects the structure of a GPX 1.1 document. To set it, supply a hash reference as (`link` and `email` are optional):
      {
        link  => { text => 'Hexten', href => 'http://hexten.net/' },
        email => { domain => 'hexten.net', id => 'andy' },
        name  => 'Andy Armstrong'
      },

- link( $href )

    The link is stored similarly to the author information, it can be set by supplying a hash reference as:
      { link  => { text => 'Hexten', href => 'http://hexten.net/' } }

- time( $epoch or $DateTime )

    Accessor for the &lt;time> element of a GPX. The time is converted to a Unix epoch time when a GPX document is parsed unless the `use_datetime` option is specified in which case times will be represented as [DateTime](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime) objects.

    When setting the time you may supply either an epoch time or a [DateTime](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime) object.

- version()

    Returns the schema version of a GPX document. Versions 1.0 and 1.1 are supported.

## Legacy methods provided for compatibility

These methods will likely removed soon as they reflect a very dated release of this module.

- gpx()

    Synonym for `xml()`.

- gpsdrive()
- loc()

    Provided for compatibility with version 0.10.
